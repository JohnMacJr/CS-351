# CS-351 Project-1: Performance Evaluation of Hash Programs

## Overview
This project looks at how different ways of handling memory and accessing data can change the performance of a hash program. We built five versions of the program, each using a different memory management methods. By comparing these, we can see how small implementation choices affect runtime, CPU load, and memory use. We also test how compiler optimizations improve performance.

##
1. What operation do you think accounts for most of hash-00's runtime?
- Most of hash-00's runtime consists of making repeated function calls and inneficient handling of memory. The lack of optimization is evdent in the extremely long   real and user times.

2. hash-01 and hash-02 both dynamically allocate memory for each hash computation.  Is there much difference time-wise between their two allocation methods?
- Yes, there is about a 6.5 second difference on -g between 01 and 02 but it is less evident under 02 and 03 optimization.

3. hash-03 avoids the allocation by using a fixed-size array.  Is there an appreciable speed difference?
- Yes, in some cases 03 performs slightly better than 02.

4. Why is hash-04's memory usage so much larger than any of the other versions? 
- Hash-04 uses memory-mapped I/O which means the operating system maps the entire file directly into the processâ€™s memory space.

5. What other compiler options did you try, and did they help at all?
- I tested -O3 -funroll-loops. Only hash-00 showed minor improvements in run times.
